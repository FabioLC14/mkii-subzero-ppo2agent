# Mortal Kombat II - Sub-Zero PPO2 Agent

## Video:

The final Sub-Zero model I trained in the video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_jyXBvkc7t1KzemiBqWyAsFkDGeqzsSd/view?usp=sharing

## Setup:
1. Install pip packages and any dependencies.
2. Find a Mortal Kombat II Sega Genesis ROM and install it with ```python3 -m retro.import /path/to/your/ROMs/directory/```
3. Copy the save states and the scenario.json (reward function definition) in gym-retro-files to /your-pip-install-folder/retro/data/stable/MortalKombatII-Genesis

Now you can play around with the train.py and play.py scripts
